🌾 Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning Regression Models
 
 
 
📌 Overview
This project presents a comprehensive benchmarking of machine learning regression models to predict crop yield (tons) from a variety of agronomic and farm-level inputs, including soil properties, irrigation types, pesticide/fertilizer usage, and seasonality.
We train and evaluate 14 supervised learning models, optimize them via GridSearchCV, and visualize both performance and error behavior using scatter and residual plots.

📊 Models Implemented
•	🔹 Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, Bayesian Ridge
•	🌲 Random Forest Regressor
•	⚡ XGBoost Regressor
•	💡 LightGBM Regressor
•	🐈 CatBoost Regressor
•	🔁 AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting
•	🧠 MLP Regressor (Neural Network)
•	📈 SVR and KNN Regressor
All models were evaluated using MSE and R² Score and tuned using cross-validated grid search where applicable.

🧪 Dataset
The dataset consists of 50 real-world samples with the following features:
•	Crop_Type
•	Farm_Area(acres)
•	Irrigation_Type
•	Fertilizer_Used(tons)
•	Pesticide_Used(kg)
•	Soil_Type
•	Season
•	Water_Usage(cubic meters)
•	🔺 Target: Yield(tons)
Categorical columns are encoded and feature scaling is applied as needed for sensitive models (e.g., SVR, MLP).
